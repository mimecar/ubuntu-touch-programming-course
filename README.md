# Ubuntu Touch Programming Course

Ubuntu Touch is a version of Ubuntu that runs on mobile devices. It can be found in phones and tablets. Although it is growing and improving little by little has a lack of applications compared to other platforms. One way to address this problem is by writing documentation to facilitate the task. For this purpose I started the course in August 2016.

The course is currently in Spanish and English. The version in Spanish was the initial version so it has more content published. For its part, the English version begins in February 2017. Each month I will publish a new translation of the English version and a new chapter in Spanish.

There are several resources associated with the course:
* [Documentation on GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/book/mimecar/ubuntu-touch-programming-course)
* [LaunchPad mailing list.](https://lists.launchpad.net/ubuntu-touch-programming-course/)
* Source code on GitHub.
* [Telegram group.](https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAAqGbgjrxl03SgBG_g)

If you have any problems accessing the Telegram group you can send me a message (@mimecar).

I hope you like the course.

*Note: The programming course will continue regardless of the future of Ubuntu Touch.*
