WeatherRecorderChart is an application for recording the temperature of a city. The values are stored in a SQLite database and include all operations: insertion, update, deletion and search. The user can configure some application parameters. These values are stored in a Settings object so that persistence is added to the application.

This version of the application can display the temperature values of one month on a bar graph.
